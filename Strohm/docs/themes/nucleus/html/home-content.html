    Strohm Native is my attempt at improving the way cross-platform mobile apps are
    developed. If you want to learn more about my motivation, please read my blog

    href="https://unfolded.dev/posts/2021-05-08-mobile-cross-platform/">ReactNative,
    Flutter, Cordova, etc: the state of the art is not good enough</a>. This project
    is under active development. It is in its early stages. I consider
    it usable at the moment, but there are plenty of rough edges. You can find a
    more detailed <a href="https://github.com/StrohmNative/strohm-native#status">status
    overview</a> on GitHub.
