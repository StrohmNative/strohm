Setting up your project breaks down into three parts: setup the common
ClojureScript side, setup the Android project, and setup the iOS project.

But first of course we create the root folder of our project.

```bash
mkdir ~/Documents/Yawn
cd ~/Documents/Yawn
git init
```

== Common Code

include::NewProject-common.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== Android

include::NewProject-android.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

== iOS

include::NewProject-ios.adoc[leveloffset=+1]
