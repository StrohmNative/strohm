The common (ClojureScript) code is built and developed using
https://shadow-cljs.github.io/docs/UsersGuide.html[`shadow-cljs`]. We're going to setup a pretty straight-forward
`shadow-cljs` project. Hence we need a `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Yawn",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Yet Another Weather Nicety is a less than exciting weather app",
  "main": "index.js",
  "devDependencies": {
    "shadow-cljs": "^2.15.5"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "watch": "shadow-cljs watch :app :test",
    "release": "shadow-cljs release :app"
  }
}
```

Install:

```bash
yarn
```

For our ClojureScript code, `shadow-cljs` needs a build config file as well,
named `shadow-cljs.edn`:

```clojure
{:source-paths ["src" "test"]

 :dependencies
 [[dev.strohmnative/strohm-native "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]] ;; replace with latest version

 :dev-http {8080  "target/"}

 :builds
 {:app {:output-dir "target/"
        :target :browser
        :asset-path "."
        :modules {:main {:entries [app.main]
                         :init-fn app.main/main!}}}
   :test {:target :node-test
          :output-to "target/node-test.js"
          :ns-regexp "-test$"
          :autorun true
          :compiler-options {:reader-features #{:test}}}}}
```

Create the main source code file `/src/app/main.cljs` and put this in it:

```clojure
(ns app.main
  (:require [strohm-native.flow :refer [create-store]]))

;; Reducer doesn't do anything yet, simply returns state
(defn reducer [state _action] state)

(defn ^:export main! []
  (tap> "Hello world!")
  (create-store reducer :initial-state {:greeting "Hello world!"}))
```

That code is pretty much the minimum you need: create a store with some initial
state, and create the root reducer. The reducer doesn't do anything yet, we'll
get to that later.

We'll also create a HTML file so that we can easily load the compiled JS into a
browser. In `/target/index.html`, put this HTML source:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="main.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    Yawn!
  </body>
</html>
```

This puts all the basics in place. We can now run `shadow-cljs`:

```bash
$ yarn shadow-cljs watch :app
shadow-cljs - config: [path]/Documents/Yawn/shadow-cljs.edn
shadow-cljs - HTTP server available at http://localhost:8080
shadow-cljs - server version: 2.15.5 running at http://localhost:9630
shadow-cljs - nREPL server started on port 56827
shadow-cljs - watching build :app
[:app] Configuring build.
[:app] Compiling ...
[:app] Build completed. (119 files, 0 compiled, 0 warnings, 2,30s)
```

When you now browse to `http://localhost:9630` you should see the `shadow-cljs`
dashboard. There should be one active HTTP server on `http://localhost:8080`.
When you click that link, a new browser tab opens that says "Yawn!". Going back
to the `shadow-cljs` dashboard, in the "Inspect Stream" tab you should see the
text "Hello world!" that was tapped in `main.cljs`.

== Hot Reloading

`shadow-cljs` comes with hot reloading out of the box. So for the final touch in
this section, add the following function to your `main.cljs`:

```clojure
(defn ^:dev/after-load reload! []
  (tap> "reloaded"))
```

Now, while having the tab with `http://localhost:8080` open, save the file. You
should now see "reloaded" appear in the `shadow-cljs` dashboard's Tap History
(Inspect Stream). In other words: `shadow-cljs` has hot reloaded the code and it
has called the hook `reload!` afterwards.
